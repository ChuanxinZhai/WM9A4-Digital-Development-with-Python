Speeding Ticket Function
超速罚单
Objective:
Write a function named 'speeding_ticket' that evaluates whether a driver should receive a speeding ticket based on their driving speed and a special condition (their birthday).

Function Parameters:
1. speed (integer): The driver's speed in mph (miles per hour).
2. is_birthday (boolean): A flag indicating whether the driver is driving on their birthday. 判断是否是生日在开车

Instructions:
- The function should return one of three strings based on the driver's speed: "No Ticket", "Small Ticket", or "Big Ticket".
                                                                                无罚单        小罚单        大罚单
- If the driver's speed is 60 mph or less, they should receive "No Ticket".     60以下 
- If the driver's speed is between 61 and 80 mph inclusive, they should receive a "Small Ticket".  61-80
- If the driver's speed is 81 mph or more, they should receive a "Big Ticket".  81以上
- On the driver's birthday, the speed limits for each ticket category are increased by 5 mph. For example, they can go up to 65 mph and still receive "No Ticket" if is_birthday is True.
